## Setup
First make sure the required dependencies have been installed:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Once the dependencies have been installed, ensure that you have created an openai API key. Make the
api key available in the environment variable `OPENAI_KEY`, you can use a dot-env file (`.env`) to
do so:

```

If you do not yet have an openai API key, you can create and manage your API keys here:

it will generate a tarot card reading for your spread.

The Seven of Cups brings confusion,
A crossroads up ahead.
But the Queen of Pentacles knows the answer can be found,
From The Sun enlightening her instead

Chorus:
A new path, a new day,
A wiser choice will lead the way.
An inner journey, a brighter light,
Answers come in second sight.

Verse 2:
The Queen of Pentacles stands still,
Confident in her decision.
Ignoring the distraction of the Seven of Cups,
In the Sun lies her true vision.

Chorus:
A new path, a new day,
A wiser choice will lead the way.
An inner journey, a brighter light,
Answers come in second sight.

```text
Generating a tarot card reading for the seeker for the following spread:
Ace of Wands, The Tower, Seven of Cups

Prompt:
Tarot card reading for the seeker with the cards Ace of Wands,
The Tower, and Seven of Cups in the style of a Robert Frost poem

Response:
A glimpse of the future through these cards three,
A Tower filled with sudden calamity,
An Ace of Wands in potential to see,
A dream of good luck throughout, the Seven of Cups all we.

So now what, the seeker asks,
Amidst the chaos of Great Task?
Look past the presentâ€™s stormy mask
As what you seek lies in the path that wand did cast.

An answer to the dilemna you seek,
In a universe so frequently bleak,
Will come from the surprises that this moment meek
Despite other cards of ill-fame cast in its shadow deep.

Your destiny to craft is in your hand,
An Ace of Wands, set to expand
To explore and understand,
Defeating fate and triumphant stand.
```
